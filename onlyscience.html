              <p>Take the first step toward a career as a microbiologist, nature conservation officer,
                 doctor, pharmacologist, marine biologist
                 and more with an Associate of Science Degree in Biology. <br>

                Biology is the study of life. It explores the diversity and similarities of 
                living things and the interaction between them and their environments. If you’ve ever wondered
                 how fingerprints are formed or why certain sounds – like nails dragged across a chalkboard – make
                  your skin crawl, Biology has the answers. <br>
                
                Biology is also linked to other sciences, such as Chemistry and Physics,
                 as each depends on the other to create life. For example, Biology depends on
                  Chemistry because living things depend on the interaction of atoms and molecules.
                   Without Physics, space, matter, energy and time and living things could not exist 
                   on Earth.</p>

               <h3>Overview</h3>
               <p>Star offers a wide range of first- and second-year courses in the fields of science and mathematics. Students benefit from lower tuition rates and smaller class sizes as compared to larger universities. Whether students are planning to transfer to earn their BSc, or simply wish an Associate of Science degree or other diploma, many of the requisite courses are available at Star. <br>

                The Chemistry department offers courses from introductory and preparatory, to first year and second year University transfer courses. Second year studies include analytical, organic, inorganic and physical chemistry. Students benefit from our well equipped laboratories and dedicated teachers</p>

              <img src="images/subjectmaths.jpg" alt="Computer Science" >
              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>Whether you are studying to be an astronaut, accountant, social worker, scientist, marketer, nurse, school 
                teacher, engineer, manager, computer scientist ... almost every career requires mathematics and/or statistics. 
                Mathematics and Statistics are a part of everyday life, from analyzing the stock market to reading the newspaper 
                to trusting the bridge you drive on. Our goal is to help all our students develop a command and appreciation of the power,
                 beauty, utility, and recreational value of mathematical and statistical ideas. <br>

                During their time at Star, most students will register for at least one Mathematics or Statistics course, as a program or degree requirement or out of interest and enthusiasm for these subject areas. 
                Star offers a wide range of mathematics 
                and statistics courses, many of which are university-transferable and can be applied towards the first two years of a university degree. Some of our courses are specifically designed for students who did not complete
                 math in high school. Star's Math and Stats Department has an excellent track record of students successfully transferring to universities such as UBC and SFU. Moreover, 
                our students typically do well in their third and fourth years because smaller class settings, greater number of contact hours, and approachable instructors prepare them for the transition into university.</p>
