                    <h2>LAND IMPORTANCE</h2>
                    <p>Star College is proud to be a part of a rich history of education in this province
                         and in this city. We acknowledge that we are on the treaty lands and territory of the Vancouver of the Credit
                          First Nation and pay tribute to their legacy and the legacy of all First Peoples of Canada, as we strengthen ties
                           with the communities we serve and build the future through learning and through our graduates. 
                           Today the traditional meeting place of Toronto is still home to many Indigenous People from across Turtle Island and 
                           we are grateful to have the opportunity to work in the communities that have grown in the treaty lands of the Vancouver.
                            We acknowledge that we are all treaty people and accept our responsibility to honour all our relations.</p>

                <h2>IS STAR RIGHT FOR ME?</h2>
                <p>Picking a career can be a tough decision. At Star, you can explore your options while earning credits you can put towards a credential,
                     with the assurance that you’re putting your time and money to good use. <br>
                     Star gives you the opportunity to interact with your classmates and ask your professors questions about what you’re learning. It’s harder 
                     to get that in first- or second-year classes at university, where there are sometimes up to 500 students per class.</p>

            <div id="transfer_to_university">
                <h2>ASSOCIATE DEGREE</h2>
                <p>An Associate Degree is equivalent to the first two years of a four-year university degree. With an Associate Degree, you can enter into the third year of a university’s Bachelor Degree program.These two-year degrees are useful as a standalone qualification and as a basis of admission to third year at university, and gives you 
                    eligibility to apply for a three-year work permit.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="how_much_money">
                <h2>HOW MUCH MONEY DO I HAVE FOR SCHOOL?</h2>
                <p>Star offers some of the lowest tuition fees in the province. If you’re planning on getting a degree from a university, you can save 
                    almost $4,500 by doing your first two years at Douglas and then transferring. Double that if you stay at Douglas to complete a four-year
                     bachelor’s degree.</p>
